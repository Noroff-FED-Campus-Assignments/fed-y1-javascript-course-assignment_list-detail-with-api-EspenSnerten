## Rapport javascript course assignment

This document will serve as my javascript assignment
Rapport & Rationale, throughout the document I will detail my design choices and the work process, ass well as the coding choices I went with.

The file structure in the premade repo broke my code, so I opted to remove it and add my own files from the repo I have been working with this week, 
I know this is not how it is supposed to be done, but even with the vite.config.js file I could not get the site to deploy, I will look in to it.

To start with, this was a harder task than I thought, I failed on so many levels so many times throughout this assignment,
but I learned a great deal, specifically form validation, when it comes to API calls I still have a huge room for improvement,
and to be perfectly honest time just ran out for me, I really wanted to include filters and a functioning search bar, but alas time ran out.

I chose the pokemon API simply because the API is really easy to work with, 
for further personal projects for my portfolio I will be choosing more complex API's that suits my app ideas. 

I did do one thing  I thought was cool and that is I opted out of using a separate page for my individual result from the array,  
I did this simply because I think It is cool and the information from the pokemon api is not that detailed, plus who doesn't love a popup, 
that said, if the individual information from the array contained more data then a individual page is absolutely required.

When it comes to the form I created I must say that the end result is pretty good, the form works and sends emails, is neatly designed, with a cool background picture for some artistic flair,  
I still have to point out the ridiculous validation length on the address input.

To sum up this rapport, I think I could have done a lot more with my API list, and recognize that it is absolutely an area I need to focus on, form validation was kinda fun, the logic of it clicked pretty fast, 
no code I wrote throughout the assignment was straight copied, but of course there is similarities with code i used for inspirationand reference, I guess that is unavoidable, 
over all a frustrating but pretty fun project in my opinion.
